# springdoc-customizer
A module for fine-grain customization of SpringDoc REST Services

## About
[springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc) provides the ability to generate OpenAPI specifications from Spring Boot REST services and offers
features for customization. The goal of this project is to extend these customization features to allow Spring Boot services to leverage helpful
features, such as serialized example injection or version customization.

This project supports Spring Boot's autoconfiguration and does not need much configuration out of the box.

## Demo
A demo project, [springdoc-customizer-webmvc-demo](https://github.com/funkyFangs/springdoc-customizer/tree/develop/springdoc-customizer-webmvc-demo), has been included to demonstrate available features.
